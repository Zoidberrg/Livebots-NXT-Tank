Livebots NXT "Tank"
===================

To make a copy of this project you first need to get all libraries for Python
Libusb
Pyusb
nxt-python

Then make the Mindstorms starter model and put the Ultrasonic sensor in the front connected to port 4

Create a robot at livebots.cc and get your robot id from the url (like http://livebots.cc/Robot/View/30 (the 30)) and paste it in runner.py instead of 40.

Now you should have a working robot connected to Livebots, if you get any issues create a new issue here @ GitHub
